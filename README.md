For my twelfth grade (2012) we were asked to create an software of 5~ windows forms and 50+ pages of system analysis and characterization.

I decided I'll do a bit more than that, and created a software for school management containing features of:
- Teacher secured login
- Students database management
- Classes, groups and lessons management
- Grades and certificates
- Teacher panel, profile and contact page
- Feature of dividing students into classes
- Disciplinary notes
- Features for printing official letters, certificates and reports
- School manager administration panel along with user permission system

The software is designed with user-friendly icons and also sounds and voice speech.
Characterization is written in Hebrew.
The software was developed with C# and WinForms.
Icons are from iconarchive.com.
Database used is MS Access.

The project was viewed by all of the school teachers and has been announced as the biggest project ever created in my school.
